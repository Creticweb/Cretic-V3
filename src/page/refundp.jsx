                    Refundwill not be provided to the user, once it is earned by the company, because of the time and energy invested by our manpower for their work done, which is not returnable. So basically, all the processing fees, payment gateway charges, admin fees, and cost of resources for the work done, will be deducted. In short, further, we canâ€™t refund any money which is paid to government bodies, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order.</p>
